![Screenshot](./Screenshot.png)

## Displays the current time on the desktop in case you hide the menu bar ##

OS X El Capitan allows you to hide the menu bar. This can be useful if you have an 11-inch MacBook Air with a small screen. Yet, some people prefer to always have the clock visible. This is where DesktopTime comes in. It displays the time centered at the top edge of the screen.

## Usage ##

Launch the app to display the time. Launch the app again to quit.

## Features ##

- it displays the time… on all spaces and fullscreen apps
- displays the current battery level (if available)


## Bugs ##

- it displays the time… even over fullscreen video and fullscreen apps
